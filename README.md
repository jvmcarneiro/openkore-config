# OpenKore Config for Idle Offline Server

Basic Kore configuration files for an offline idle pre-re server.

A small hoster of characters that compose a functional party is set up to try and go through the whole game in an idle manner, requiring user input only to change the current farming map.

Each character has separate wxstart shortcuts that point to specific control files.
